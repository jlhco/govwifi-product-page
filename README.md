# GovWifi Product Page

This is the product page for GovWifi. It is a [middleman site](http://middlemanapp.com/) originally copied from the [product-page-example](https://github.com/alphagov/product-page-example) repo.

## Getting Setup for Development

Software required to be installed to get the local version working are:

- ruby (recommended version is `2.7.2`)
- docker
- npm (installed with nodejs)

To pull the code from Github, enter the following into your terminal (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal on Mac):

- `git clone https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-product-page.git`
- `cd govwifi-product-page`
- `gem install bundler`
- `make build`
- `npm install`

You can now open the codebase in any text editor and make changes.

## Getting Started

To make the site viewable in your browser:

- `make serve`
- Open your browser and go to http://localhost:4567

## Testing Locally

Before starting, run `bundle install` in the project to ensure all necessary gems are installed.

To run tests locally, run the following command from the project root directory:

```bash
$ rspec ./spec/features/
```

## Deployment

This project is deployed to github pages

## Contributing

The `source` folder contains all the pages that you will want to change, eg: `index.html.erb`. Whenever you save a change, the site will automatically reload so you can see your changes at `http://localhost:4567`.

Once you have made any changes, do the following to save your changes to git and push to github:

- `git add -A`
- `git commit -m "ADD A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CHANGES"`
- `git push`

### External contributions

We welcome contribution suggestions from outside of the GovWifi team, but the process is slightly different:

**How to contribute**

1. Fork the project
2. Create a feature or fix branch
3. Make your changes (with tests if applicable)
4. Raise a pull request

The pull request must be reviewed by members of the GovWifi team and the content community.
